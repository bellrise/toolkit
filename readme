toolkit
=======

My personal command line toolkit, composed of tiny programs.


dbytes
------

Dump bytes from a file in hexadecimal format, similar to what xxd does.
I needed a lightweight tool for dumping bytes without the need of installing
vim. Example:

	00000000 : 746f 6f6c 6b69 740a 3d3d 3d3d 3d3d 3d0a : toolkit.=======.
	00000010 : 0a4d 7920 7065 7273 6f6e 616c 2063 6f6d : .My personal com
	00000020 : 6d61 6e64 206c 696e 6520 746f 6f6c 6b69 : mand line toolki

The data is split into 3 sections, the offset from the beginning of the file,
the hex bytes themselfs and the ASCII representation of the bytes. Anything
that is not printable is replaced with a dot. In order to only get the bytes,
you can use either cut or awk:

	$ dbytes file | cut -d: -f2
	$ dbytes file | awk -F' : ' '{ print $2 }'


resolve
-------

Resolve a hostname and get the IP address for it. Returns nothing if the host
name resolution fails. For example:

	$ resolve localhost
	172.0.0.1

You can check the result in a shell script:

	[ -z "$(resolve $DOMAIN)" ] || echo 'Domain exists'
